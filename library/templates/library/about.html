    <h2>About Book Port</h2>

    <p>
        Book Port is an online destination for readers who want to buy, sell, 
        or exchange books with ease. We bring together a diverse collection of
        pre-owned classics, contemporary fiction, and specialised programming titles,
        offering an affordable and sustainable way to discover your next great read.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our platform is built around the idea of giving books a second life. 
        Whether you're looking for a rare find, a favourite novel, or a practical 
        technical guide, Book Port makes it simple to explore a growing catalogue
        of well-maintained, pre-loved books from trusted owners.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each title includes essential information—publication year, description,
        price, availability status, and a cover image—so you can make informed 
        decisions before purchasing or requesting an exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
        Book Port is designed to be user-friendly, transparent, and community-focused,
        helping readers connect through the books they love.
